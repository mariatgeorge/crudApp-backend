# CRUD App - BACKEND

Spring Boot application built using Spring Initializr consisting of REST APIs for user management.

## Launch the Spring Boot application 

Clone the code into any IDE and execute the main method in the com.assessment.demo.DemoApplication class. The embedded tomcat server starts running in the default port number 8080.

```bash

```
## Database Support

This application makes use of in-memory H2 Database for data storage.
##### NOTE:
File-based storage has not been implemented in this project. Therefore, the in-memory database is volatile, and results in data loss after application restart.
